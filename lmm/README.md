# Linear mixed models

Outputs from the file `lmmselect.R` files give performance metrics for the e-values method for the two linear mixed model experimental settings. The file `get_outputs.R` gives actual fitting functions to obtain these metrics, while `lmmselect.R` provides parametrized wrappers around them.
